      "question": "What is Coffee Engine?",
      "answer": "CoffeeEngine is a small but powerful layer that sits between your users and your AI features.\n\nThink of it as a payment-aware gate:\n\n• A user wants to access a Custom GPT or AI-powered feature\n• CoffeeEngine checks whether they've supported you (for example, by buying you a coffee)\n• If yes → access granted\n• If not → a friendly nudge instead of a hard paywall\n\nIt's designed for developers who want to monetize without:\n• building full subscription systems\n• managing user accounts\n• or turning their project into a SaaS monster\n\nLightweight, modular, and embeddable anywhere."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "label": "💰 Is it free?",
      "question": "Is this free to use?",
      "answer": "Yes — the code is fully open source.\n\nThere is:\n• no CoffeeEngine subscription\n• no platform fee\n• no hidden percentage cut\n\nYou only pay the standard fees of the payment provider you choose (e.g. Buy Me a Coffee, Stripe in the future, etc.).\n\nCoffeeEngine simply verifies:\n\"Has this user paid or supported this project?\"\n\nNothing more. Nothing less."

    {
      "id": "q3",
      "label": "🚀 How does it work?",
      "question": "How does Coffee Engine work?",
      "answer": "At its core, CoffeeEngine does one thing very well:\n\nIt verifies payments and turns them into access signals.\n\n• A payment provider sends a signal (API / webhook / verification call)\n• CoffeeEngine validates it\n• Your app or Custom GPT asks: \"Is this user allowed?\"\n• CoffeeEngine answers with a clear yes / no\n\nNo user database required.\nNo long-lived sessions required.\nJust simple, verifiable logic you can trust."

      "id": "q4",
      "label": "⚙️ How do I set it up?",
      "question": "How do I set this up?",
      "answer": "Getting started is intentionally boring (in a good way):\n\n1. Clone the repository\n   Everything you need is already there.\n\n2. Create a Buy Me a Coffee API key\n   This is how CoffeeEngine verifies payments.\n\n3. Deploy to Vercel\n   One-click deploy, edge-friendly, zero infra stress.\n\n4. Set your environment variables\n   API keys, secrets, done.\n\nOnce deployed, you can plug CoffeeEngine into:\n• Custom GPT actions\n• AI-powered web apps\n• Internal tools\n• Experiments\n\nIf it can make an HTTP request, it can use CoffeeEngine."
